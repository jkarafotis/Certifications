# Laptop Hardware 1.1 #

- Laptop Batteries 
    Many batteries use Lithium-ion batteries
- Laptop keyboards
    Noramlly can be easily replaced with a single ribbin cable connecting it

    Many laptops are able to use external Keyboards if the keyboard is not working
- Laptop Keys
    Some repairs may require a replacment of an individual keycap
- Laptop Memory
    The most common type of memory in mobile devices is called Small Outline Dual in-line memory or SO-DIMM

    Often easy to repair however some laptops do not provide easy wasy to add or repair this memory

    In this case the memory will be soldered on to the system board itself requiring a full system board replacement
- Laptop Storage
    The first type of storage we might encounter is in the form of a magnetic spinning disk or Hardrive as we would better know it as

    Many newer Laptops might have Solid State Drive or SSD's which have no moving parts and can provide less latency (Increased read write speed)

    The last storage option covered is a M.2 storage solution this storage comes in a smaller form factor and is also very moduler this form factor uses a very diffrent kind of connection than listed before
- Replacing Laptop Storage
    Replacing the storage of a laptop is usually easy to replace after opening up the back of the laptop and taking out a few screws and then sliding the drive out

    When replacing the M.2 Stoarge it is even easeir it typically takes just one screw before you can unplug the drive and replacing
- Migrading from a HDD (Hard drive disk) to a SSD (Solid State Disk)
    This replacement of storage can be an impressie upgeade for any device using an older form of storage specifically a Magnetic Disk Hard drive

    One Method of upgrading a system woudl be to install a new opperating system on the SSD and moving user documents over manually this can be time consuming but is a solution when upgrading the system

    Another method potentially a more elegant one would be to create a clone or an Image as its more likely called this is where you use a imaging software to replicate everything on a system and then move that image to the new drive you are trying to fix/upgrade

    You can also use whats called a Drive-to-drive Image which is when you image directly from one drive to another without a in between step to copy it over this would rewuire either two systems simultainously running or a system that is capable of having two drive attached
- Wireless and Bluetooth
    Many newer laptops with bluetooth connectivity and wifi will have that feature built into their motherboard
    
    While many older laptops might have a Mini PCI or a Mini PCI Express so that you can add additional wireless connectivity (This might be for connecting 802.11 which is for local area network or a bluetooth connection)
- Biometrics
    Newer opperating systems may give additional authentication options to provide access to a system besides just a regular password

    For example you may want to use Biometrics to log in (like fingerprint readeor or face recognition)

    Usually two parts of this they are the software in the opperating system to run these additional checks as well as the hardware needed to validate things like your face or fingerprint
- Near-filed communication (NFC)
    This is a short distance method of athentication that is being integrated into system security it involves getting close to a specified NFC reader that can detect data transfer it and ensure you are who you say you are

    Examples of this are like tap to pay on our phones or smart watches

# Laptop Displays 1.2 #

- Portable LCD
    LCD stands for liquid crystal display

    The Main advantages are that it is lightweight, uses low power and relatively inexpensive

    The main disadvantages are that true blacks can be difficult due to the need for light to shine in frome behind as well as
    the need for seperate backlights (Florescent, LED, etc.) which are difficult to replace
- LCD Technologies
    TN (Twisted Newmatic LCD) original LCD tech, Fast response time however has bad viewing angles

    IPS (In plane Switching LCD) Excellent color representatiion but is more expansive o produce than the TN displays

    VA (Vertical alignment LCD) A good compromise between TN and IPS displays with good color representation but a slower response time than the TN Displays

    OLED (Organic Light Emitting Diode) this is an organic compound that when recieving electic current will light up. The main advantages of an OLED Display are that it is thinner and lighter while still being more flexible not even requiring a glass front screen and there is no backlight in these diplays. These displays are moslty found in tablets, phone and smart watches. They have very accurate color representation but come with a cost a bit higher than LCD's
- Wi-Fi antennas
    The Laptop displays will very likely have multiple antennas inside due to this being the highest part of your laptop. 
    
    Wrapped around the laptop screen you can find antenna wires for WiFi (Main and aux) as well as Bluetooth 
- Webcam
    Many laptops have built in cameras abkle to do video capture. 
    
    Most are located at the top center and include the capability of both audio and video 

    This camera and microphone will typically come with specialized drivers and software to allow them to run
- Flourescent vs. LED backlights
    CCFL (Cold Cathode Flourescent Lamp) Requires higher voltage and power, adds thickness to the display, no longer a common backlight but will be found in oulder laptops

    LED-Backlight LCD Display use LEDs instead of flourescent by using LEDs around the edges of the screen and an array of LEDs behind the screen. The latest laptops are LED-Backlit.
- Backlight and inverters
    If you are working with one of the older LCD screens using CCFL you might find a converter. This is due to the lights needing AC power but our laptops will use DC power.

    Therefore thes convertes allow for the lights to properly be powered without issue 

    One way to determine if your Backlight has failed is to point a flashlight at the screen if you can make out some of the information on the screen it is likely your screen is fine but the backlight itself has failed

    For CCFL displays you may be able to just replace the converter to fix the problem but on other dispalys you might have to replace the whole screen you will have to check the documentation to determine what to do for your model.
- Digitizer
    If you are using a hybrid type laptop (One with a keyboard tablet type setup) you might use something like a pen device to give inputs this is useful for graphical type input and this type of input is possible due to a part called a digitizer by converting analog input into digital signals that the computer to use.

    Another type of use case for a digitizer would be in the case of a touchscreen.



# Connecting Mobile Devices 1.3 #

- USB (Universal Serial Bus) 
    High speed wired communication used for charging and data transfer

    Micro-USB is a smaller USB connectyion and is common worldwide

    Older devices may use a mini USB which is slightly larger

    Newer devices may use USB-C which is a 24 pin double sided USB coinnector capable of acting as diffrent signals but using the same connection (USB 2.0/3.0/3.1/4). The USB-C can transmit DisplayPort, HDMI and thunderbolt connections
- Lightning Connections
    This is an apple proprietary connection that uses a 8pin digital signal and is used on Iphone and ipad in their older devices

    Some advantages over micro-USB are that it has a higher power output, is reversable and is a simpler design
- Serial Interfaces
    DB-9 also called DE-9 is a commonly used serial connection before universal serial bus standards. It was commonly used to send RS-232 signals  which has been an industry standard since 1969

    These serial communication standards are mostly used for modem connections

    Now these are used as configuration ports on switches, routers firewalls etc but you will most likely need to use a converter cable from USB to DB-9 since these ports no longer exist on most laptops
- NFC (Near Field Communication)
    This is built in to many phones today and facilitates the ability to send small amounts of data over a limited area.

    Things like payment systems, Air drop and identity verification are all uses for NFC today

    Note they use short range transfers with encryption support
- Bluetooth
    This is a high speed communication over short distance PAN (Personal Area Network)

    Connects devices to smartphones, Tethering, headsets, health monitoring, smart watches and more
- Hotspot
    You can turn you phone into a wifi hotspot allowiong anyone to connect to your phone using 802.11 

    Not all phones support this hotspot connectivity and it may cost more to unlock this feature from your provider

# Mobile Device Accessories 1.3 #

- Touch Pens
    Allows for users to activate the interface without touching it 

    Good for note taking or signatures as well as precise selections
- Active Sylus
    Provides more percision than a touchpen

    the stylus communicates direclty to the device and is sometimes pressure sensative with the ability to have extra programmable buttons
- Drawing pad
    If your device does not have a active stylus capability you can add a Drawing pad with an active stylus that uses a external digitizer to give you that very precise input

    Third party device that supports many OS
- Trackpad
    Replaces the mouse on laptops and is built in

    there are also external trackpads that are bluetooth connected and battery powered

    on some laptops you are able to disable the trackpad
- Headsets
    Hands Free audio using bluetooth or wired connections

    For wired connections USB is common for many computers  
    
    3.5 mm jack that uses a TRRS connector (tip-ring-ring-sleeve)

    For apple devices you can use the lightning port instead
- Speakers
    External speakers connect to your device over a bluetooth connection and can improve audio quality significantly 
- Camera/webcam
    commonly external on desktops but internal on laptops

    allows for multimedia applications, photos and video conferencing
- Docking Station
    Allows for quick access to many needed ports or set up your laptop in a place it typically always is

    can extend laptop interface with extra ports

    I use this to set uop my desktop at home and instantly connect my speakers and HDMI easily with one connection
- Port Replicator
    Similar to as docking station but does not commonly have a expansion card option and usually connects via USB

# Cellular Standards 1.4 #

- Cellular Networks
    Seperates land into 'cells' where antenna cover a cell with certain frequencies

    some of the original networks were 2G networks and they consisted of 2 global standards
    
    These networks were good for trasmitting voice communication but had very limmited ability to send data over these networks. They were originally circuit switch networks and needed to be upgraded for data connectivity.
- GSM (global system for mobile communications) 
    This included about %90 of the marked and was originally an EU standard with worldwide coverage

    Used by AT&T and T-Mobile in the USA and allowed you to move you SIM card (Subscriber Identity Module) from phone to phone

    Originally GSM standard used multiplexing which is where everyone got their own little slice of time
- CDSM (Code Division Multiple Access)
    Everyone communicates at the same time

    Each call uses a diffrent code

    The codes were used to filter each call on the receiving side

    Mainly used by Verison and Sprint but not much adoption worldwide
- 3G Technology
    introduced in 1998 and allowed for much more capabilities of data transfer speed (ususally several megabits per second)

    Bandwith improvments allowed for new functionality like GPS, mobile television and video on demand
- 4G and LTE
    Long term Evolution (LTE) is a 4G technology 

    Converged standards from GSM and CDMA providers

    Is based on GSM and EDGE (Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution) 

    standard supports download rates of 150 Mbits/s

    LTE Advanced (LTE-A) was found in some areas allowing for double the download rates hitting up to 300 Mbits/s with best connection
- 5G 
    Fith Generation of cellulat networking and was launced in 2020

    Signigficant performance improvements including the abiity to one day have 5G performing at 10 gigabits per second and can currently work at about 100-900 Mbits/s

    Significant IoT (Internet of Things) impact if bandwith becones less of a problem allowing for greater data transfer from these devices which can help identify and monitor notification or allow additionl cloud processing 
- Updates
    Many of the updates for these celuular standars happen withing the software of the device itself 

    PRL Updates (Preferred Roaming List) allows for you device to identify specific towers that you device will regulary connect to 

    If you see a OTA update (Over the air) it may hve to due with an update to your Roaming list to ensure the propper expected connection to towers
- Hotspots
    On some mobile phones you can merge your Celluar network into a 802.11 network

    This effectively turns your phone into a cellular router allowing for any device using 802.11 can connect to your pone to use the internet

# Mobile Device Connectiviy 1.4 #

- Bluetooth Pairing
    Built in security to prevent malition bluetoth connections

    Usually requires a pin to verify you are connecting to the right device 

    typically you only need to pait one time and future connections should be automatic

    Steps may vary based on manufacturer
- Bluetooth Pairing Process
    Enable Bluetooth on both devices

    Set device to discoverable mode

    Select discovered device

    Confirm or enter PIN (Personal Identification Number)
- GPS (Global Positioning System)
    Created by the US Department of Defense
    
    With at least 4 satellites in view we can begin to have precise navigation

    Determines locations based on timing diffreces between the satellites

    Our Phones on top of using GPS to determine location can use WiFi and Cellular towers as well to locate our device
- MDM (Mobile Device Management)
    manage company-owned and user-owned mobile devices

    Centralized managment of mobile devices 

    set Policies on apps, data, camera, etc.

    Allows for partition of user device to increase securrity 
- MDM Configurations
    Allows for Global Configurations on all mobile devices 

    This is helpful for things like Email configuration for corperations to ensure every user has access

    Also can enforce app restrictions to allow or restrict app instillations or prevent unauthorized app usage

# Mobile Device Configurations 1.4 #

- Configuring a mobile Device
    Many settings on a monile device are preconfigured like your telephone and text messages

    Email is handled diffrently across all corporations and configurations can vary

    You may also need to configure Data synchronization across the mobile devices within your organization to something like a cloud server for important backup and recovery of company data
- Microsoft 365
    Microsofts email services are Outlook and Exchange 

    You must authenticate with a username and password for access to this service

    You can also synchronize what data is backed up for each user including the main, contacts, calender, reminders and notes

    This is the same process for Google workspace formerly known as G Suite
- iCLoud
    This is an integrated servie within the ios and iPadOS enviorment

    Similar to many sevices you must sign in with a username and password 

    This service also has extensive synchronization options to customize what data should be backed up

    Synchonizes to macOS to easily backup incase of a lost ios device just log into your icloud account and your data will automatically download
- Syncronizing Data
    Data types include Mail, Pictures, music, video, Calender, Contacts, etc.

    Data caps and transfer costs can be expensive and can be done using cellular or wifi with 802.11 

    You are able to configure the ability to do cellular downloads to prevent excess use of expensive data

    It is almost always cheaper to use Wifi for downloads than using Cellular networks

# Introduction to IP 2.1 #

- A series of moving vans
    Efficielnty move large amounts of data using a shipping truck

    The network topology is the road this would be the ethernet, DSL and cable system

    The truck is the internet Protocol (IP) and the roads are designed for this specific truck

    The boxes in the trucks hold all of your data like TCP and UDP

    Inside the boxes are more things including application data or specific funtions of your network
- IP (Internet Protocol)
    To send data from your device to a server it would work in this way

    Ethernet Header (this is coming from your device)

    Ethernet Payload (This is where the data packages are held and being transfered)

    Ethernet Trailer (This is the destination and this is where the data gets broken down and processed)

    Within the Ethernet payload it consists of the IP header and the IP Payload (which contains our data) in that order

    Within the IP Payload we could have either TCP Data which would contain a TCP Header and a TCP Payload

    The TCP Payload can be broken up into many different types of data including HTTP
- TCP and UDP 
    TCP and UDP are transported inside of the IP and is encapsulated withint the IP Protocol

    These are both diffrent ways to move data from place to place and have diffrent features for different applications

    You may hear TCP and UDP talked about existing in the OSI Layer 4 which is the transport layer of the OSI Model

    TCP and UDP allow for additional functionality of the ethernet protocol like Multiplexing which is the ability to use many differen applications at the same time communicating to different servers
- TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
    We often refer to this as a connection oriented protocol 
    
    that is becasue there is a formal connection that needs to be set up before information can flow from one device to the other

    As well as a formal process to tear down that connection as well

    Sometimes refered to as Reliable delivery this is because it responds with a verification that a message has been recieved

    TCP is also capable of tracking the order of messages and is able to reorder them and track what has been recieved in order to ensure complete data transfer

    Lastly  TCP is able to do data flow managment which allows you to throttle how much a device feels it is getting data too quickly it can slow down the process in order to receinve the data at a more reasonable Rates
- UDP (User Datagram Protocol)
    This is a connectionless process in which there is no formal way to open or close a connection

    Due to there no specified connection there is also no way to verify the data has been recieved like with TCP therefore this is sometimes refered to an "Unreliable" delivery

    There is no reordering of data or retransmissions if data was not received properly due to not having a formal connection in this protocol

    Unlike TCP with UDP there is no flow Management and the sender decides the data transfer rate
- Examples of Communications using UDP
    UDP is most associated with Real-time Communication for example phone calls

    In a situation where you need to know instant status at all times there is no time to stop and resend old data since time doesnt stop for your network

    Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is an example of a connectionless protocol this is how we automatically assign IP addresses to our devices

    Trivial File transfer Protocol (TFTP) This is anothter example of a use case for a UDP connectionless protocol

    Due to there not being a way to validata ll the data was reieved its up to the application to keep track and decide if other steps are neccesary 
- Examples of Communications using TCP
    All connection-oriented protocols the prefer a "return reciept" might use TCP 

    HTTPS (Hypertext transfer Protocol Secure) is an example of this ensuring all of our web data is recieved when we tansfer it

    SSH (Secure Shell) This is another example in which we can connect via to other termanals via encryption
- Speedy delivery
    When delivery of data from one IP to another on a network we need to decide where this data will go and how it will be processed

    In addition to the IP adress with TCP and UDP we have a Port number which is sort of like a room number within our IP 

    This allows us to direct the data directly to the service that is looking for the information
- Using ports
    To use Ports from one device to another the reciept server and the client sending the data will need their IP address, Protocol(TCP/UDP) and the server application port number

    When dealing with Ports there are two types Ephemeral and Non-Ephemeral Ports

    Non-Ephemeral ports are port numbers that are well know and typically never change these ports typically range from 0 - 1023 and are for services like HTTP and HTTPS

    Ephemeral ports are much more temporaty ports these are ports that are opened to send data to a server client or to host a temp application and are determined in real time by the client these ports are typically located in the range of 1024 - 65535

    Most services will use Non-Ephemeral port numbers but this is not alwasy the case some services might use dynamic port numbers depending on the actions it is taking

    Port numbers are for cmmunication and not security by using an odd port number it will not hide the application since you can search for open ports

# Common Network Ports 2.1 #

- Port numbers
    It is important to have well know port numbers for applications running on a system this is so the client and the server can communicate on this port and transfer data effectively

    It is also important for any firewall that may be in the middle of that communication many firewalls will block any traffic from an unverified port addresses

    There are many known typical port numbers and it will seem like strick memorization at first but the test may ask about a specific service and what port it may run on so its impprtant to know
- File Transfer Protocol (FTP) 
    is used to move files between systems

    This service is run on two diffrent ports tcp/20 for active mode data aka for actually moving the files

    As well it runs on tcp/21 to control the file transfer itself

    This service typically needs a username and password to authenticate but sometimes allows for generic/anonymous login

    FTP includes features like list, add, delete, etc.
- Secure Shell (SSH)
    used to access the terminal front end of a server 

    SSH is an ecrypted communication link that runs on tcp/22

    it lookas and acts the same as Telnet
- Telnet 
    another method to access the terminal front end of a server and runs on tcp/23

    this allows remote login to the server but the major diffrence is this is not ecrypted like SSH was
- Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)
    the most common email service to recieve emails and it runs on tcp/25

    other protocols are used for clients to reveive emails these protocols are IMAP and POP3
- Domain Name System (DNS)
    our way to convert web addresses to real IPs for our computer to communicate with and this service typically runs on udp/53
- Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) 
    This is how we automatically assign IP addresses to new useres on a network and this service runs on udp/67, udp/68

    you will need a DHCP server in order to do this however this functionality is ususally built in to the appliances or routers we already use today

    The DHCP server will have a pool of IP addresses that are able to be assinged and when there is a new user they get applied in real time

    Each Ip assigned is given a lease and it must renew at a set interval

    If necessary you can also use DHCP reservations to maintain a specific IP address on certain devices this is typically for devices that make up the nework desired functions and may communicate with other devices
- HTTP & HTTPS
    Hypertext Transfer Protocol is our way to communicate in the browser and by other applications 

    HTTP runs on tcp/80

    HTTPS runs on tcp/443 and has encryption
- POP3/IMAP
    These services authenticate and recieve email messages from an email server

    POP3 or the Post office Protocol version 3 runs on tcp/110 and has basic mail transfer functionality this service doesnt allow for synchronized inboxes across devices

    IMAP or INternet Message access protocol v4 runs on tcp/143 and this allows for synced inboxes across devices
- Server Message Block (SMB)
    This is a protocol used by Microsoft to transer files and information between systems using that opperating system like file sharing or printer sharing

    Also called CIFS (common internet file system)

    SMB uses a number of diffrent protocols to communicate and if youre communicating to a older windows machine you ar eprobably using netBIOS ove tcp

    NetBIOS stands for network basic INput/output system and runs on udp/137 for the name sevices and tcp/139 for the session services

    On most modern windows systems netBIOS isnt used they communicate directly using tcp/IP typically at port tcp/445
- Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)
    This service runs on a network and can gather statistics froma network device when querried

    the querry service runs on udp/161

    You are also able to set up indicators for the network called traps that when triggered will send a singal to a set destination 

    traps sercices are run on udp/162

    There are 3 versions to be aware of for SNMP 

    version 1 is the origninal and communicates with structored data in the clear or unencrypted

    version 2 includes data type enhancementents allowing for bulk data transfers but is also done in the clear

    version 3 allowed for message integrity of data becasue it includes Authenitication and encryption
- lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)
    Used to manage directories and runs on tcp/389

    commonly used in microsoft active Directory
- Remote Desktop Connection (RDP)
    This allows for remote access to someone elses desktop 

    commonly uses tcp/3389

    Most servers running rdp are windows however there are applications for almost all opperating Systems in order to use rdp
