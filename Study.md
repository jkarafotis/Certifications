# Laptop Hardware 1.1 #

- Laptop Batteries 
    Many batteries use Lithium-ion batteries
- Laptop keyboards
    Noramlly can be easily replaced with a single ribbin cable connecting it

    Many laptops are able to use external Keyboards if the keyboard is not working
- Laptop Keys
    Some repairs may require a replacment of an individual keycap
- Laptop Memory
    The most common type of memory in mobile devices is called Small Outline Dual in-line memory or SO-DIMM

    Often easy to repair however some laptops do not provide easy wasy to add or repair this memory

    In this case the memory will be soldered on to the system board itself requiring a full system board replacement
- Laptop Storage
    The first type of storage we might encounter is in the form of a magnetic spinning disk or Hardrive as we would better know it as

    Many newer Laptops might have Solid State Drive or SSD's which have no moving parts and can provide less latency (Increased read write speed)

    The last storage option covered is a M.2 storage solution this storage comes in a smaller form factor and is also very moduler this form factor uses a very diffrent kind of connection than listed before
- Replacing Laptop Storage
    Replacing the storage of a laptop is usually easy to replace after opening up the back of the laptop and taking out a few screws and then sliding the drive out

    When replacing the M.2 Stoarge it is even easeir it typically takes just one screw before you can unplug the drive and replacing
- Migrading from a HDD (Hard drive disk) to a SSD (Solid State Disk)
    This replacement of storage can be an impressie upgeade for any device using an older form of storage specifically a Magnetic Disk Hard drive

    One Method of upgrading a system woudl be to install a new opperating system on the SSD and moving user documents over manually this can be time consuming but is a solution when upgrading the system

    Another method potentially a more elegant one would be to create a clone or an Image as its more likely called this is where you use a imaging software to replicate everything on a system and then move that image to the new drive you are trying to fix/upgrade

    You can also use whats called a Drive-to-drive Image which is when you image directly from one drive to another without a in between step to copy it over this would rewuire either two systems simultainously running or a system that is capable of having two drive attached
- Wireless and Bluetooth
    Many newer laptops with bluetooth connectivity and wifi will have that feature built into their motherboard
    
    While many older laptops might have a Mini PCI or a Mini PCI Express so that you can add additional wireless connectivity (This might be for connecting 802.11 which is for local area network or a bluetooth connection)
- Biometrics
    Newer opperating systems may give additional authentication options to provide access to a system besides just a regular password

    For example you may want to use Biometrics to log in (like fingerprint readeor or face recognition)

    Usually two parts of this they are the software in the opperating system to run these additional checks as well as the hardware needed to validate things like your face or fingerprint
- Near-filed communication (NFC)
    This is a short distance method of athentication that is being integrated into system security it involves getting close to a specified NFC reader that can detect data transfer it and ensure you are who you say you are

    Examples of this are like tap to pay on our phones or smart watches

# Laptop Displays 1.2 #

- Portable LCD
    LCD stands for liquid crystal display

    The Main advantages are that it is lightweight, uses low power and relatively inexpensive

    The main disadvantages are that true blacks can be difficult due to the need for light to shine in frome behind as well as
    the need for seperate backlights (Florescent, LED, etc.) which are difficult to replace
- LCD Technologies
    TN (Twisted Newmatic LCD) original LCD tech, Fast response time however has bad viewing angles

    IPS (In plane Switching LCD) Excellent color representatiion but is more expansive o produce than the TN displays

    VA (Vertical alignment LCD) A good compromise between TN and IPS displays with good color representation but a slower response time than the TN Displays

    OLED (Organic Light Emitting Diode) this is an organic compound that when recieving electic current will light up. The main advantages of an OLED Display are that it is thinner and lighter while still being more flexible not even requiring a glass front screen and there is no backlight in these diplays. These displays are moslty found in tablets, phone and smart watches. They have very accurate color representation but come with a cost a bit higher than LCD's
- Wi-Fi antennas
    The Laptop displays will very likely have multiple antennas inside due to this being the highest part of your laptop. 
    
    Wrapped around the laptop screen you can find antenna wires for WiFi (Main and aux) as well as Bluetooth 
- Webcam
    Many laptops have built in cameras abkle to do video capture. 
    
    Most are located at the top center and include the capability of both audio and video 

    This camera and microphone will typically come with specialized drivers and software to allow them to run
- Flourescent vs. LED backlights
    CCFL (Cold Cathode Flourescent Lamp) Requires higher voltage and power, adds thickness to the display, no longer a common backlight but will be found in oulder laptops

    LED-Backlight LCD Display use LEDs instead of flourescent by using LEDs around the edges of the screen and an array of LEDs behind the screen. The latest laptops are LED-Backlit.
- Backlight and inverters
    If you are working with one of the older LCD screens using CCFL you might find a converter. This is due to the lights needing AC power but our laptops will use DC power.

    Therefore thes convertes allow for the lights to properly be powered without issue 

    One way to determine if your Backlight has failed is to point a flashlight at the screen if you can make out some of the information on the screen it is likely your screen is fine but the backlight itself has failed

    For CCFL displays you may be able to just replace the converter to fix the problem but on other dispalys you might have to replace the whole screen you will have to check the documentation to determine what to do for your model.
- Digitizer
    If you are using a hybrid type laptop (One with a keyboard tablet type setup) you might use something like a pen device to give inputs this is useful for graphical type input and this type of input is possible due to a part called a digitizer by converting analog input into digital signals that the computer to use.

    Another type of use case for a digitizer would be in the case of a touchscreen.



# Connecting Mobile Devices 1.3 #

- USB (Universal Serial Bus) 
    High speed wired communication used for charging and data transfer

    Micro-USB is a smaller USB connectyion and is common worldwide

    Older devices may use a mini USB which is slightly larger

    Newer devices may use USB-C which is a 24 pin double sided USB coinnector capable of acting as diffrent signals but using the same connection (USB 2.0/3.0/3.1/4). The USB-C can transmit DisplayPort, HDMI and thunderbolt connections
- Lightning Connections
    This is an apple proprietary connection that uses a 8pin digital signal and is used on Iphone and ipad in their older devices

    Some advantages over micro-USB are that it has a higher power output, is reversable and is a simpler design
- Serial Interfaces
    DB-9 also called DE-9 is a commonly used serial connection before universal serial bus standards. It was commonly used to send RS-232 signals  which has been an industry standard since 1969

    These serial communication standards are mostly used for modem connections

    Now these are used as configuration ports on switches, routers firewalls etc but you will most likely need to use a converter cable from USB to DB-9 since these ports no longer exist on most laptops
- NFC (Near Field Communication)
    This is built in to many phones today and facilitates the ability to send small amounts of data over a limited area.

    Things like payment systems, Air drop and identity verification are all uses for NFC today

    Note they use short range transfers with encryption support
- Bluetooth
    This is a high speed communication over short distance PAN (Personal Area Network)

    Connects devices to smartphones, Tethering, headsets, health monitoring, smart watches and more
- Hotspot
    You can turn you phone into a wifi hotspot allowiong anyone to connect to your phone using 802.11 

    Not all phones support this hotspot connectivity and it may cost more to unlock this feature from your provider

# Mobile Device Accessories 1.3 #

- Touch Pens
    Allows for users to activate the interface without touching it 

    Good for note taking or signatures as well as precise selections
- Active Sylus
    Provides more percision than a touchpen

    the stylus communicates direclty to the device and is sometimes pressure sensative with the ability to have extra programmable buttons
- Drawing pad
    If your device does not have a active stylus capability you can add a Drawing pad with an active stylus that uses a external digitizer to give you that very precise input

    Third party device that supports many OS
- Trackpad
    Replaces the mouse on laptops and is built in

    there are also external trackpads that are bluetooth connected and battery powered

    on some laptops you are able to disable the trackpad
- Headsets
    Hands Free audio using bluetooth or wired connections

    For wired connections USB is common for many computers  
    
    3.5 mm jack that uses a TRRS connector (tip-ring-ring-sleeve)

    For apple devices you can use the lightning port instead
- Speakers
    External speakers connect to your device over a bluetooth connection and can improve audio quality significantly 
- Camera/webcam
    commonly external on desktops but internal on laptops

    allows for multimedia applications, photos and video conferencing
- Docking Station
    Allows for quick access to many needed ports or set up your laptop in a place it typically always is

    can extend laptop interface with extra ports

    I use this to set uop my desktop at home and instantly connect my speakers and HDMI easily with one connection
- Port Replicator
    Similar to as docking station but does not commonly have a expansion card option and usually connects via USB
