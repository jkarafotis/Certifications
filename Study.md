# Laptop Hardware 1.1 #

- Laptop Batteries 
    Many batteries use Lithium-ion batteries
- Laptop keyboards
    Noramlly can be easily replaced with a single ribbin cable connecting it

    Many laptops are able to use external Keyboards if the keyboard is not working
- Laptop Keys
    Some repairs may require a replacment of an individual keycap
- Laptop Memory
    The most common type of memory in mobile devices is called Small Outline Dual in-line memory or SO-DIMM

    Often easy to repair however some laptops do not provide easy wasy to add or repair this memory

    In this case the memory will be soldered on to the system board itself requiring a full system board replacement
- Laptop Storage
    The first type of storage we might encounter is in the form of a magnetic spinning disk or Hardrive as we would better know it as

    Many newer Laptops might have Solid State Drive or SSD's which have no moving parts and can provide less latency (Increased read write speed)

    The last storage option covered is a M.2 storage solution this storage comes in a smaller form factor and is also very moduler this form factor uses a very diffrent kind of connection than listed before
- Replacing Laptop Storage
    Replacing the storage of a laptop is usually easy to replace after opening up the back of the laptop and taking out a few screws and then sliding the drive out

    When replacing the M.2 Stoarge it is even easeir it typically takes just one screw before you can unplug the drive and replacing
- Migrading from a HDD (Hard drive disk) to a SSD (Solid State Disk)
    This replacement of storage can be an impressie upgeade for any device using an older form of storage specifically a Magnetic Disk Hard drive

    One Method of upgrading a system woudl be to install a new opperating system on the SSD and moving user documents over manually this can be time consuming but is a solution when upgrading the system

    Another method potentially a more elegant one would be to create a clone or an Image as its more likely called this is where you use a imaging software to replicate everything on a system and then move that image to the new drive you are trying to fix/upgrade

    You can also use whats called a Drive-to-drive Image which is when you image directly from one drive to another without a in between step to copy it over this would rewuire either two systems simultainously running or a system that is capable of having two drive attached
- Wireless and Bluetooth
    Many newer laptops with bluetooth connectivity and wifi will have that feature built into their motherboard
    
    While many older laptops might have a Mini PCI or a Mini PCI Express so that you can add additional wireless connectivity (This might be for connecting 802.11 which is for local area network or a bluetooth connection)
- Biometrics
    Newer opperating systems may give additional authentication options to provide access to a system besides just a regular password

    For example you may want to use Biometrics to log in (like fingerprint readeor or face recognition)

    Usually two parts of this they are the software in the opperating system to run these additional checks as well as the hardware needed to validate things like your face or fingerprint
- Near-filed communication (NFC)
    This is a short distance method of athentication that is being integrated into system security it involves getting close to a specified NFC reader that can detect data transfer it and ensure you are who you say you are

    Examples of this are like tap to pay on our phones or smart watches
